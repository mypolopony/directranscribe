 here from this. It's a smooth ride. We work off of buoyancy. So that's why you feel that boat like feeling because we are floating on the air. You know, the blip itself is just a little longer than the 747. It's about eight people and then of course two pilots. And look here, we're flying over downtown right now. What a shot. You can see everything from the warm memorial to the capital. You can see the.

 We're at the moment, 2,500 feet high, which is 1,800 feet above ground. We have arrived. We are over the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It's really beautiful from up here, just to see the operations and how they're coordinated down below. I had no idea. Inside the Indian 500, Indianapolis Motor Speedway is literally a golf course. It's also cool to see the snake bit, the states that were Brett Michaels.

So I didn't get a ride from the good year blend here this morning, but listen, a great big thanks gratitude to the good year folks. It was really something, because you know, we see the good year blend but all the big sporting events for years and years, but actually being it is quite something special.

I didn't realize how many windows were on the blip until you got in there. It's a fish bowl, it's all in those. So how many... how many G's did you go? You know, you got a rub deck. Charlie pulled like nine G's. We were going about 50 miles an hour. It doesn't go fast. So it's kind of swayed back and forth a little bit. It does. It's in some ways a little bit like being in a helicopter because it can really be a new...

 to be hitting turn one right here at the start of this race at 230 miles an hour. I think that can speak to anybody. And then you start telling the stories as we're going to do starting at 10 a.m. this morning. We're going to go through the field, tell stories and why people should care about these drivers and why they should tune in. It's a cultural thing. Gee, yesterday the three of us got in a car and did a lap, but was probably 120 miles an hour. And I have to tell you, I got out. My hair was like this. I let the window open. I look crazy. Look, rookie.

They are truly gladiators. These are the best of the best athletes. I think some of the best drivers in the world are right here. And if you're into F1, you know what open-wheel cars are.

His career highs seven and two thirds and a night with the Mets desperately needed an outing like this. He's given it to him. Yes, they so far so good for Carlos Mendoza in the Mets. He said Peterson to Diaz. It's kept his pitch count down and he's in line to do it. I want to know how they come up with 62% of the Mets. He said Peterson to Diaz.

America is obsessed with Gordon Ramsay's Secret Service. Oh my God. He's exposing spoiled entrees with a secret diner. That's funky. This ration is close. An on-emission to save struggling restaurants. You're not going to be the one who broke me. I'm here to tell you the truth. Gordon Ramsay's Secret Service.

 and FS one. Bobby Miller fully stretched out as a starter. No question he has back out there for a second. And he works right one on Luis Torrance with the endos and Taylor to follow in this inning. It's the Mets 4. The Dodgers 2 is a got three runs in the fourth inning to take the lead. David Peterson has not budge from there. The Dodgers in the ninth to be tasker Hernandez. Freddie Freeman and Andy Pahez. The second hit of the game for the week.

 the Mets organization Francisco Alvarez is the catcher now and for the future for a backup guy. He's swinging it. We talked about his defense. That is a nice luxury that most teams do not have. Lead off man aboard. Bianzo. Off for the bench tonight. Drew walk is first time. It takes downstairs for ball one. This is another guy and we're talking about the Mets offense. The figure is going to take off.

 But if you don't have a vehicle that can tow motor homes all the way to go, great way to hit the open road I mean everything is built right in that bathroom bedroom kitchen and as you can see like this one right here Only 25 feet long beautiful and on a diesel Mercedes chassis of that. Do you need a special license to drive this? You don't know you don't you actually don't need one to tow either which is really nice Which is why I love the Coleman's because you don't have to upgrade you have an SUV get a light duty truck Those work great for it.

 believe it or not since this is a fifth wheel, fifth wheel is a lot easier to tow because of where the hitch goes in the bed of the truck. This is a tow behind. Yeah, this is a tow behind. I mean, you wouldn't think of it from looking at it, right? You look like you're in a beautiful vacation home, which is these are great for setting up on mountain properties, setting up on beach properties. You want to stay someplace for six months, switch places. You don't have to get a time share. You don't have to get a hotel room travel. These are the way to go for that awesome summer vacation.

Okay, before we go, quick question. Are you doing confessions as well? Only if people really need it. Okay, I saw some people here last night that definitely need it. Thank you Father. This is fantastic. All right, right back to you guys. Only Rachel walks out at the Indy Car 500 and finds a mass.

 from Indiana dairy farm. And this year the Indy 500 veteran milk presenter is Abby Hurd, the owner of Hurd dairy in Kendallville. And the rookie milk presenter is Ashley Stockwell, a dairy farmer at Stockwell Farns in Hudson, and they join us now. So great to have you Abby and Ashley. So I'm gonna start with you Abby. For those who don't understand where this tradition started, why don't you explain the milk tradition here at the Indy? Well, thank you so much for having us. So in 1936,
---
Sun May 25 04:52:53 PDT 2025
 here at the track ever since. And so you're both Gary farmers. And so what is your role here today, Ashley? Yeah, so I get to hand the milk to the chief mechanic and the team owner as the rookie milk presenter. And then Abby, you know, she's a revetter in this year. So I get to hand to the winning driver. I keep giving Ashley some tips. So I'm like, definitely don't drop the milk. I don't want to be a milk meme. That's the biggest thing. Well, I love this tradition. By the way, I love milk. So this is a good, and I'm from Wisconsin. Yeah.

 we all work so hard. It's so funny how like the racing world and dairy farmers have so much in common. I mean, I feel like we have a pit crew that helps run our farm. I mean, it takes a bunch of people just like an Indie car driver does. You know, we're the fourth generation raising the fifth generation. I have two daughters. So to be this is only the second time two women have been milk presenters at the Indianapolis 500. So to be a role model and help inspire our children. We're hoping for that and we're a robotic dairy. So we have robots at milk our cows. So our cow.
---
Sun May 25 04:54:16 PDT 2025
 across the state of Indiana. That's right. It is a tradition. It is a family business. Even when you get a couple robots in there, you still need humans. How do you keep that tradition alive? Because there's a lot pulling kids away from this line of work. Ashley, how do you keep that alive? You know, it's just really important for us to work as our generation, Dairy Farm as well raising the fourth generation. It's important for us to just continue to educate the community on dairy and what how light's good for you. And rely on our partners and just to promote. That's why the tradition here is so strong.

I don't have time to waste. So I'm with you in spirit, but you guys are having a lot more fun. That is true. You know here in Washington, we're trying to track the big stories, including the big beautiful bill, which it may feel like it's on a race track with some, you know, dips and turns.

 roiling uh... washington right now is this uh... latest book uh... out about all of the mental failings of uh... joe biden and political has obtained some ads uh... that sort of underscored just how bad joe biden was their campaign ads that the campaign ended up not even being able to use because biden was so kind of out of it i think we were going to play a couple of real quick and get your response ad
---
Sun May 25 05:07:22 PDT 2025
 Shannon, you are somebody who understands the inner workings of Washington, DC. What does it tell you that this lead to political at this moment? Well, it very interesting. So we've got one of the co authors of the book, Alex Thompson, the co-author of Original Sin. And so this is one of those things I'll try to ask him about as well because, you know, there's been pushback from the Biden group and in his inner circle saying, oh, no, it was a timing issue. That's why we didn't use those ads. But we've all seen them and you can see that they've been
---
Sun May 25 05:08:04 PDT 2025
 We've all seen them and you can see that they're very little slivers of President Biden speaking a sentence or two here. They're a lot of jump cuts or edits where you're not even seeing him speaking. It's kind of a voiceover. So they don't look ideal. If the idea is that you're trying to project strength and ability to run a second term, these ads wouldn't have been your strongest move. And they apparently were tested with groups. Again, the accusation is that they weren't usable the other side saying no is more of a timing issue.
---
Sun May 25 05:08:44 PDT 2025
 The quote, quote, quote, though tapering Thompson report that it was because the footage wasn't usable, Biden advisors argue that the footage didn't make it on there simply because of timing. A Biden spokesperson tells Politico that the campaign tested the ads with focus groups, but did not deploy them before the president dropped out of the race following his disastrous June 2024 debate. It'll be interesting, Shannon. If you can dig a little into whether this raises maybe more questions.
---
Sun May 25 05:09:22 PDT 2025
 and really shock most Americans. And you have to wonder whether the inner circle around President Biden was lying to themselves or lying to us or both, but they talk about in the book that there were cabinet secretaries who were actually worried that the president was not able to handle that emergency to a phone call. One of them describes being shocked when he saw the president in the last year's presidency. He seemed disoriented out of it. He was standing there with his mouth hanging open. I mean, these are cabinet members. Did they?
---
Sun May 25 05:10:01 PDT 2025
 Well, the media also had an obligation to tell that and the guys writing that book knew just as much as we did and we were calling it out the whole time. So that might be a good question for them as well. We're going to start there. Yeah, we'll start there. I love you, Shannon. All right. Well, Senator Federman is very upset because he says that now that he's kind of recovered from his stroke, that the Democrats are not, are now upset that he has come up to
---
Sun May 25 05:10:41 PDT 2025
 really not upset about his health, what they're upset about is that he now has more nuanced and maybe in the middle positions. Here's what he said. He said, my doctors warned me years ago after it's public that you're getting help for depression. People will weaponize that simply things are turned. That's exactly what happened. This became the bellichet girlfriend story of politics. It just keeps going and going. Fair enough, Shannon. You think he's right?
---
Sun May 25 05:11:19 PDT 2025
 This is somebody who works with him who cared about him who says, yes, we celebrate that he got help for that and that he was transparent about it. But I'm worried that he's not following through with a plan. The Hill reports that there are a number of Democrats who are worried about him, who want to find out the best way to try to intercede or help him. That they have real concerns. Ellis, and he has been showing up stepping up the schedule in the Senate doing hearings and other events. So he says, yeah, this is just being weaponized against me. The fact that I received mental health care and
---
Sun May 25 05:11:59 PDT 2025
 conversation that we're going to have and sit down with them. And so it's certain to come up and to see how he's doing and whether he thinks this is just a political hitch-op or whether people are genuinely concerned. That's the question. Well that'll be a must-watch interview and we will be tuning in. I'm sure you'll get to the bottom of that. So thank you Shannon and watch Foxy Sunday today on Foxy's channel. Thanks so much. Hey Shannon. We wanted to get to the bottom of the bellicic scandal as well.

 with about one third of people still confusing it with veterans day. It appears to be a generational divide with just 27% of Gen Z understanding the holidays purpose compared to 56% of baby boomers. Memorial Day was first observed all the way back in 1868 as a way to honor military personnel who died in service for our country. Never forget our fallen heroes and those are your headlines. Back to you guys at the track. All right.

 of Memorial Day. And the answer is very simple. It's to do what Pete Heigsetth is doing there. And you get school kids to come out and do whatever it is, whether it's cleaning up, polishing up, anything that gets them in touch with these warm memorials so that they can at least pay attention long enough to recognize the incredible sacrifices that these people made before them. It was a beautiful gesture. It's one that I hope catches on with all kinds of communities across our country.

 our dad military members are those who passed on and made the greatest sacrifice. It's also a piece of history, you know, that until that belongs in our school. And I know that a lot of my kids in their schools have had veterans they've gone to mass on veterans say they've had veterans come in and tell their stories to the schools. There's something our public schools are doing if you have a number like that. Yeah, and you know, it's such a great point Rachel when you talk about sharing stories.

 these heroes and share that story with someone else. That's how you keep it alive. You know, every Memorial Day and I've anchored Memorial Day from Arlington National Cemetery in years past. I remember four Marines that died in Iraq in 2003. Part of the HMM 268 Red Dragons. I was on helicopters aboard when they went down and lost their lives. Olly North talked about I was actually supposed to be on that helicopter. It's something that stuck with me more than anything in my entire life. Remembering every year their sacrifice.

 So you're looking live at the snake pit here at the Indy 500. And the party's already rocking. Thanks to our next guest. That's right. You know I'm as a four time Super Bowl champ, but today he's the snake pit grand marshal Rob Grunkowski is here now. Grunk, thanks for being here. You might have the coolest job of anybody all day. Yes, I really do. You know, there's all the pit announcers. You can be up in the booth breaking.

 and people are going to be going absolutely crazy and I'm going to be egging it on. So you've been learning a lot about this race. Get getting all the sights all the sounds. We were talking a little bit off. The mom and me is coming up. Gronk was actually saying this is the cleanest place ever. Yes, it actually is for how big it is and all the stands like the stands look beautiful. They're the grass is green. It's not all muddy all over the place with so many people here. It's just really cool. The speculation here for other fans is just one.
---
Sun May 25 05:22:11 PDT 2025
 but you hung out with some of the drivers last night. They're truly elite athletes in order to drive some of these cars 240 miles an hour around this track. Yes, you got to be an elite athlete in order to be able to be a driver here at the Indy 500. And the training is phenomenal. These guys train. I was talking to Alex Pello yesterday from Spain who has never won the Indy 500, but he has won plenty of the other champion. Four dips, four out of five coming into today. Yes, and I'm cheering for him to win today because he was such a hump.

 become the racers that they are, the hard work that they put in the workouts that they go through, they're vigorous. And it's kind of like being a professional football player with how much they train. And it's really cool to hear it from him, especially live and personize him when I talk him. You think you can get one of these cars and drive it? I don't think so because I'm too big. My knees will be going through the steering wheel. Yeah, but I think you're rooting for Polo because he gave you this is your element for the snake fit with your name. We're counting out. And I hear a lot about the snake fits.
---
Sun May 25 05:23:34 PDT 2025
 I'm going to get the question on my head so I don't get knocked out. When you have that conversation with them, what did he tell you about the sport that really surprised you? Oh, that's a really good question. You know, how he works together with his team and how fast the pit is, well, what is it when they get the oil job, their gas will be filled up? Yeah, the pit crew and how fast they operate. It's six to seven seconds to change the tires and fill up the gas. When I heard that it takes six seconds to put in 15 seconds.
---
Sun May 25 05:24:16 PDT 2025
 even though he's driving around the course by himself, he still needs his team to be at top of his game. Yeah. Speaking of going around the course, truth told here, are you jealous? Your pal, Tom Brady, got to go real fast with Jimmy Johnson. Here's a little bit of what he put on Instagram. All right. All right, TD, are you been going to far after you yourself as he goes right now? You still got to do it? I won't work. It depends. Want to see how good he actually is.
---
Sun May 25 05:24:56 PDT 2025
 No, especially Tom except since he retired, Tom took his talking smack game to a whole new level and I was actually with Tom all yesterday when we got the meat Alex Pello we're with Jeter as well and straight hand and it was just such a cool situation and then they went off and did their lap around the race course But he went hang hung out with Jimmy Johnson to do the lap. Well, I got to hang out with Jimmy Johnson all last year He was a he just retired on the Fox pregame set. He just retired this year

 He can't party like me. He can't handle the snake pit. Now, I was actually talking to his assistant yesterday. We were like, hey, we're going to have to spike his drinker, something to get him into that mood. But have him pop over to the snake pit to get into DJ boot and just start rocking out. We wouldn't have to do that. I just want to let you know, there is a Christian ministry and there's a free stop for his confession. Right down here. So I just think that you might have to go on a flight with a little cap thing. Yeah, I'll get a cap thing. So it's easy finally.

 production car and it holds a top-tier record of just an amazing American car built in Kentucky. And that's actually that's a car you can, first of all, what you can buy, it fits exactly what you can buy. There's no modifications to it. Yeah, so it's really interesting you're watching the Chevrolet viewership and buy a buy-out. But then it's very interesting, there's no other stuff to flip the baby's head. So when it comes to Indy car, obviously the bodies are of the cars are all the same, but what's different you have?

 wonderful facility where they make the cabin tops and you know they're really good at that. So when we get into what the car is prepped for here for Indy it's different than most other tracks with very high speed obviously but it's a ton of integration goes into the air-on development of it. So the aerodynamics and computational fluid dynamics are used heavily to find the chassis set up here and really go fast. So those are the secrets and of course the engines are very similar in displacement by 2.2 liters but they're...

 We met two metal bonnet soldiers here last night. It's emotional. And the passenger tree that's here, and some of the general motor defense vehicles here will be with the metal bonnet people here today. But when you start to race here, it's hard not to have the hair on the back of the head and that stand up with all the soldiers, the parade, of our military, the families, the sacrifice for our country. That's what it's all about. And it's right here in the center of our country and in the anti-anastasia. It's going to be probably that.

 So we've been a leader on school choice, parents being in the drive, received their own kids' education. You need to give me more car funds. I've got to keep you busy. I know, don't, don't, we don't have to bring him on. But I remember in the Senate for six years, I was on that committee health education labor pension. Gressel with the Secretary of Education about that very issue. Here coming back as governor, you can do something about it. There you're one of a hundred senators, you've got to get 60 to agree to it.

 eliminated. It is one of many that were never meant to be there in DC and they give me Carter to that back in 79. That place needs to be downsized. I miss that because that's what I talked about for six years but here again I'll echo here in Indiana what needs to be done there and I'm keeping close and touch with my friends from the last six years and the administration as well.

 country. The American, the American general, one of the things that's coming out of this, we've got Collins working with Bobby Kennedy over at HHS, is going to take the junkies out of snap and that's something you want to be here in Indiana. You're actually a leader. It was a really an honor when they came to Indiana first, Oz and R.F.K. and that whole idea that our food ought to be nutritious and ought to be good for us.

 in our own insurance plan many years ago, stressing wellness and prevention, nutrition, exercise. But if I do, this is the idea of taking it out of snap. So you're going to get help from the government. We're not going to use our tax dollars to poison you and give you chronic diseases. It doesn't make sense. And that's where you get the worst of government involved. They want to push it, I think, for the wrong reasons. Then you get industry buying into it. That's not going to fly with the current administration. No.

We did have a formal dance. And a racist or made my down for me. Oh, oh. It was just a treasure. Well, you're a treasure. But we're so happy to have you.

 like the closest thing, the woodstock back in the day I hear. So it's going to be a party. It's going to be a lot of fun and people are going to be going absolutely crazy and I'm going to be egging it on. And I'm pumped to be here. I wasn't sure what I was getting into, but it's giving me the chills and it's just, you know, feels good to be around this atmosphere. I was talking to Alex Pello yesterday from Spain, who has never won the Indy 500 but he has won plenty of the other champs. Four dips. Where'd a five come into the game? Yes. And he's I'm cheering for him to win today because he was such a humble guy.

 Quarter teaspoon of salt, just to flavor those guys up a little bit. Alright. And now we want the cauliflower to get spotty brown. That's gonna take three to five minutes. Okay. Alright, so it's been five minutes. Beautiful. And it was gorgeous already. Gorgeous already. Really nice browning. That's the whole pipe. Ta-da! What about teeth? Alright, now we're gonna be adding some beans. And the lentils would typically add two types of beans to this recipe. They would add the fudge okta, which is a flat, fresh green bean, kind of like a reminder.
---
Sun May 25 06:04:05 PDT 2025
 good old conventional green beans, runner beans, can't go wrong. There they go, that's six ounces and they're cut in two to two and a half inch pieces. Okay. Add a quarter teaspoon of salt, season those guys up a little bit. And we're gonna let this go for another two to four minutes, just until the green beans start to turn dark green. Really developing flavor here. That's right. So it's been like three minutes, the green beans have started to do their thing, they're getting darker and a little bit browning. Let's transfer them to a bowl here, they can hang out.
---
Sun May 25 06:04:44 PDT 2025
 Now we're going to build a sofrito. This is where we really start to get in all that layered flavor. That makes it so good. And we're going to start with one red bell pepper. That is finely chopped. Yeah, nice and chopped. So medium heat here. All right. I'm also going to add a quarter teaspoon of salt. Season that up. And we'll just let this sizzle here for about seven minutes. And we're looking for a little color. A little bit of browning on the cup. Yep. Smells good.
---

 tomato paste. And we're going to cook that for about a minute. We just want the pepper pieces to get nicely coated here. And that adds really nice umami depth to the sofrito. Okay, so here is three garlic cloves and some. Half a teaspoon of smoked paprika, other magic ingredient. Yes, well that. And a quarter teaspoon of saffron. And that just adds that beautiful golden color. And that's the whole paycheck. It's worth it.

 smells like a Kew that's time to keep moving here. This is a quarter cup of dry sherry. Just want to cook that until all the excess moisture evaporates. All right, all of our moisture is just about evaporating. So now it's finally time for the rice. So a cup of rice, a new calisparra or bomba, both are really nice, Spanish rice's. Okay. If you can't find those, it's also okay to use arboreal. All right. Now we're just going to start.

 nice even layer. And now we have butter beans that are going to go on top. This is our second bean. Remember I mentioned we had the green beans? And now this is one can of butter beans that's been drained. You really want to seek out these butter beans. Their size is perfect for this. You don't want to use small white beans here. You're going for another ingredient like the cauliflower that is toothed, some in meaty. We want some decent sized pieces here. We're not fooling around. This is like the real deal. So there's our butter beans. And now here's the cauliflower and the green beans.

 of chicken broth. It's going to gently pour that in. If you want to make this fairly vegetarian, it's fine to use a vegetable broth here too. Alright, so we want the rice to be completely submerged here. I'm going to turn up the heat, bring this up to a boil, and then I'll lower the heat and we'll let this simmer until the liquid is just below the top of the rice. So it's been about 15 minutes and you can see we're starting to see the rice here kind of poke through that liquid. That's right.

 hit with serious criminal offenses. Do you ever wonder why King Charles is the leader of all these dogs? The answer lies in this frame. One dog is lying flat in his feet on the ground while the others are watching the king serve his supremacy. But what does lying still actually mean? In dog language it's considered a sign of submission. A way of saying, I bow down to your strength. This brown dog keeps resisting and even tries to bite the king's paw. But the loyal dogs didn't tolerate this.

 Right before baking you take the dough and you make a couple of slashes or scores on the top of the bread now You can use a very sharp knife to do this But why not use the right tool for the job and that tool is a baker's lawn and Adam's here He's gonna tell us more exactly as he said you can get away with a paring knife You can get away with the utility knife if you want but the right tool is a baker's lawn Let's back up for a second the reason you do this is because when bread bakes the moisture in the
---
Sun May 25 06:40:53 PDT 2025
 your ruptures, it can cause mis-shape and load. If you make those slashes scoring it, you control the weak spot where the moisture escapes. Engineering the vents. Yeah, you're engineering the vents, exactly. That's the perfect way to put it. And this loaf shows that. There were a couple of scores. And so it was predictable how the bread was going to expand. Another reason to do it is to put ears in a loaf. That's very typical in a baguette. That's the little flap that sticks up. And that's the mark of a well-made baguette.
---
Sun May 25 06:41:33 PDT 2025
 They're great. Yeah, you'd expect to buy that but you can actually do that at home. You can do that at home if you have the right Lomb and that's what we're going to talk about. Lomb is French for Blade. We tested seven breadloms. They were priced between seven dollars and a little over 29 dollars and testers use them to score 10 loaves of penneleve and eight baguettes and then the baguettes in particular they put in those slashes that will make the ears. Of course. These are basically raised

Sun May 25 06:42:11 PDT 2025
 laid onto the handle. Some of them felt a little finicky. You have to tinker a little too much. That felt kind of risky to some of the testers. This one just has a simple screw. You unscrew it like so. The blade comes off. Put the blade on, stabilize it with your thumb, screw it back on. Very simple, very secure. Another reason the testers like these is because you have both sides of the blade exposed. And that's good because not only are some big
---
Sun May 25 06:42:48 PDT 2025
 kind of dull or gunked up, then the second one is already exposed. You can just flip it over and score with the other corner without having to reorient the rate. The handles are obviously very important when you're dealing with such a sharp blade. Testors preferred handles, again, like this one. This is a pretty simple shape and it just let them get comfortable in lots of different hand positions. As opposed to something like this one, which has this obluxy little sort of baguette thing, but that limited hand positions.
---
Sun May 25 06:43:26 PDT 2025
 Whereas for a lot of control, for intricate patterns, some bakers want to choke up on that to control the blade more, and the handle has to allow for both types of grips. One that had completely different kind of handle is this guy here. That's adorable. This one's round. This took some getting used to for the testers because it's such a different design. But once they got used to it, they found that actually holding it this way gave them a lot of control. Another question the testers considered is whether you want to have the

 distinct looking ears on their loaves and most looms will allow for one or the other configuration. However, I have two examples of the same loom here and you can see one of the blades is straight, the other one is curved. So some looms will let you do it either way. That's a big benefit. Very versatile. And in fact, this is the winning loom. This is the Baker of Seville Artisan Fred loom. It's about $16. This is the one that's adjustable so you can have a curved or straight blade in the...
---
Sun May 25 06:44:43 PDT 2025
 Very nice. And then there was a second one. There's one that Testers chose as the best for intricate scoring. And that was this guy here. This is the WireMonkey UFO Bread Journey Lomb. It's about $28. And this is the one that took a little bit of getting used to, but once you're used to it, Testers really understood why it's such a favorite because it gives you great control over the blade. So if you want to pick up a baker's lawn, if you're baking lots of bread at home, then the winner is the Baker of Seville Artisan Bread Lomb, and it runs about...

Earlier this month, Senate Majority Whip, Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, told Maria on this program that he was very confident he has the votes to get it over the finish line. Do you believe you'll be able to match the House's spending cuts? Well, I do and actually our number is a little higher than that of what we'd

 spending under the bloated budgets of the Biden administration for the last four years that have given us the highest inflation. Joining us now for this Sunday morning futures exclusive is Missouri Senator Eric Schmidt. Senator, thank you so much for being here. Want to get your take on how extensive the Senate's changes are going to be because depending on who you talk to, you get a different answer. And also, 1.6 trillion in spending cuts is it possible the Senate could go deeper, say, 2 trillion?
---
Sun May 25 07:04:13 PDT 2025
 and now it does come over to the Senate. And I think we're all pretty committed and unified on this idea of actually delivering on President Trump's campaign promises and for the American people. So you saw those tax cuts are gonna be made permanent and extended for middle class families. That's about $5,000 up to $5,000 per household. You've got border funding here to expedite more deportations. You've got money for national defense, which is critical. So I think everybody understands how important that is. But yeah, I do think the Senate's gonna try to look and see if we can find some more safe.
---
Sun May 25 07:04:52 PDT 2025
 bill even more beautiful. Okay, even if you get a little bit deeper on the spending cuts, you still have four trillion being spent on the tax extension and the new tax policies that President Trump promised the American people. So depending on how you score this, there's still going to be a little leftover to pay for. Many say growth is going to get us out of it. Is that your view? I do. And I think you've seen at least even in the House version, the largest spending reduction for mandatory
---
Sun May 25 07:05:29 PDT 2025
 reforms permanent so we're gonna have other things to do but as relates to this I do think there's critical mass and I ultimately think the Senate's gonna come together after we sort of work through this to find some more savings but also make sure that we've got you know the no tax on tips we've got the no tax on overtime all those things that President Trump ran on and receive that historic mandate for the American people winning the popular vote sweeping the battleground state so we'll be in close communication with the White House on that with our house partners but in the Senate it's our turn to take a look at this

Sun May 25 07:06:07 PDT 2025
 don't need any votes from democrats we don't expect that they're going to have suddenly come to their senses info for this kind of policy so we've got some work to do but we feel pretty uh... positive about it and i just want to underscore the point that you made earlier which is the extension of the twenty seventeen tax cuts effectively makes it so americans do not get a tax hike uh... and that is really important to working class american so you add those new uh... tax cuts to it as well and and certainly there's big savings ahead which is really important to the overall policy the big question though is
---
Sun May 25 07:06:46 PDT 2025
 and I think we'll have that June work period to make that happen. So I think that's a great goal for us to have. You've also got some of this debt-feeling ex-state sometime in August. So we understand that the time is of the after-essence. We need to deliver for the American people because as you mentioned, maybe cataclysmic if those cat-cats are extended, everybody's here to find and making sure we don't do that. And you also all those other things, the border security money and their finishing.

 a limiting that so there's a lot of things that we're trying to do in this one big beautiful bill that i'm confident the senate come together on and i'm so glad you brought that up because everyone is focused on the tax cuts and of course the spending cuts as well but those defense changes the energy policy changes that are going to be implemented uh... there's an auto tax break for made in america vehicles which goes hand in hand with tariff policy as a president has outlined it there's significant emphasis on rolling back and getting rid of these by the air policies that really just didn't work

 get all of the things that are sort of happening at one time you've got this you've got this uh... one big beautiful bill that deals with a lot of tax policy in some regulatory reform you've unleashing american energy dominance right now you've got president trump rebalancing trade for the first time really since the cold war ended when you put all those things together tax policy regulatory policy energy policy trade policy that it those are all of the ingredients that lead us to have this you know sort of golden age for america we're working class families

 and border security you are introducing a bill to expand the president's authority to deport criminal illegal immigrants from this country tell us about it yeah we do by the way fifteen million people in here illegally over one million of those that we know of uh... our violent criminals it's a president trump is using every tools disposal to deport those folks in my view this mass migration needs to be met with mass deportations and so along with actually moody center for four

 Back when the Democrats weren't insane in the 1990s, there was a bipartisan reform that allowed you to, if people came here, there's a group, if they were illegal immigrants, if they were here for less than two years, you had expedited removal outside of the court system with a border agent, immigration officials, and this would expand it. So if you're part of a criminal gang, if you're a violent felon, it's expedited removal, the two-year window isn't as relevant anymore. It's just the person that's here, we want to get you out of here as quickly as possible. And how would this play with what's happening?
---
Sun May 25 07:09:57 PDT 2025
 that's working its way through the courts. I think he's got every ability as the article to Commander-in-Chief to declare a predatory incursion. That's making its way through. He's had significant victories at the lower court level on the temporary status that Joe Biden did on the way out. He's also got the normal process for deportations which are moving forward. And this would be an additional tool. This would be an expedited removal if you're a violent felon, if you're part of a criminal gang, a terrorist organization. You don't even need to go through those other processes. Basically, somebody...

 This will allow him to really execute on his campaign promise from mass deportations. Okay, Senator Eric Schmidt, we so appreciate your time, happy Memorial Day weekend. Thank you. Yep, thank you. All right, well as we honor those who have died in service to our country on this Memorial Day weekend, Maria got an exclusive look at the FBI's Wall of Honor with FBI Director Cash Patel and Deputy Director, Dambon Gino. Take a look. So this is the Honor Wall. That's right. This is...
---
Sun May 25 07:11:14 PDT 2025
 also some who were killed, serving in a lot of duty but related to such things as 9-11 illnesses. So people who died decades later because of something caused from 9-11. So Donald clever died because he was breathing in, he was there on site on September 11th, 2001, he dies in 2024. Yeah, digging through debris, toxic fumes on 9-11, stand out at an agent and if you look at this wall there's so many more folks like that tragically.
---
Sun May 25 07:11:51 PDT 2025
 funds 9-11 survivors for law enforcement and that's just not a non-partisan issue. You're right. You're right. I'm Laura. Laura was in Florida, special agent. I can tell you what happened. I have a high-altradity servant of search warrant. One of these horrible demon child pornographers. Just a horrible horrible scene. Laura and Daniel both, as you can see, 36, 43 years old and time lives ahead of them. So young. Yeah, look at the photo.

Sun May 25 07:12:28 PDT 2025
 bankers, you know, where bankers are going to rest bad guys. It's a difference. Do you put this wall up director? You wanted everybody to see it every day. It's part of the what we call the FBI experience here, which we're revamping. We want students to come in. We want young adults to come in and we want families to come in to see what it takes to secure this nation. And this is the starkest reminder that you can have, not the history, not events like 9-11 or the Unibomoroko Homosity.

Sun May 25 07:13:06 PDT 2025
 of September of Daniel Napp was in Puerto Rico. Yeah, so all over the place and it goes back throughout the history of the FBI, not just modern times. We did our ceremonies since it's police week, we did our Wall of Honor ceremony where we added two names this year and we'll continue to do it. The obvious goal is to make sure no one is killed in the line of duty, but we're up against it trying to protect our guys. How proud does this make you?
---
Sun May 25 07:13:44 PDT 2025
 You know the director and I were at the ceremony yesterday as he said he gave the opening remarks and I closed it out and I said that all the police officers and the families in the room So you know I was giving a speech once and a spouse of a law enforcement officer said you know what the greatest sound in the world is Velcro at night now if you serve the law enforcement, you know exactly what that means It's the sound of the body armor with that thick velcro coming off and it means your husband or wife is home safely And you know when you come in this room, I think it really grounds you
---
Sun May 25 07:14:23 PDT 2025
 by the pictures of these heroes. Sometimes it doesn't end well. And we always have to keep that mind. That's why the director has made these the wall of honor experience even in our new building. It's gonna be right there. Are you gonna see that when you come in so you know exactly what you do? Great thanks to our service members. Meantime up next to look at the state of the economy under President Trump. And if we'll see any trade deals in the coming weeks, Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Falkander joins us next.

 Secretary, Michael Falkender. Great to have you on the program. Thank you so much for being here. Just want to get your take on the announcements coming from the president on Friday because they did impact the markets. When you're dealing with the EU and negotiations are difficult and we haven't had a trade deal since the one with the UK, does this give us a sense of how overall talks are going or just specifically with the EU and can it be worked out? Good to be with you. These are issues directly with the EU. Part of the challenge they have is
---
Sun May 25 07:19:58 PDT 2025
 the problem that we face around the world are what we call non-tariff barriers. These are the requirements on exports that go into certain countries or the restrictions that they place. Many of those requirements are done at the individual country level. And so this is why Secretary Besan talks about, you know, there being a negotiation problem when we're working with the EU, is that some of the pieces have to be done at the central EU level, whereas others addressing why certain products or the requirements that they impose on the standards.
---
Sun May 25 07:20:36 PDT 2025
 individual countries at the table and the EU as a whole while we're doing these negotiations. And also with Apple the 25% tariff the president is saying that the iPhone is sold in the United States. He wants the iPhone to be made in the United States. Apple has already committed capital to invest in America and also said it's going to move some of its production out of China over to India that's not good enough for the president but a 25% tariff would hit pretty hard. Is there any wiggle room there? Yeah I mean the jack of the

Sun May 25 07:21:13 PDT 2025
 a lot of auto manufacturing, steel manufacturing, but also electronics and pharmaceuticals manufacturing back here. We need to rebuild that industrial base because we can't have happened what we saw during the pandemic, which is that certain products are almost exclusively made overseas. And then when we get into any kind of shock, the export of that product bringing that product back into the United States is made difficult. The best way for us to make sure that we have secure supply change for the American people is for that
---
Sun May 25 07:21:52 PDT 2025
 United States. We're not looking to have it move from turning to India. We would like to see that activity right back here. Alright, we'll be watching it out that plays out now to the big beautiful bill. Of course, we're dealing with tax cuts that the American people need. We're dealing with some spending cuts to pay for it, but there will be some left over and people are worried it's going to contribute to the deficit here in America. We've got a debt problem. We've got a deficit problem. Are you confident that we will be able to grow our way out of this? We are because if you
---
Sun May 25 07:22:30 PDT 2025
 when it comes to the tax environment so that we can increase access to capital and allow American people to keep more of the wages that they earn. But another big piece is the deregulatory component. So as we tell businesses, as we take some of the strangles that the Biden administration put on businesses and give them the opportunity to do what they need to do, we believe we can get back to the kinds of growth rates that we saw during the first Trump administration. Because Jackie, what did we have during those three years prior to the pandemic?
---
Sun May 25 07:23:08 PDT 2025
 three percent growth for two out of those three years. We believe that by, again, bringing back all of the incentives for manufacturing to take place here, by unshackling American business, by having an energy dominance position, by improving access to capital, and very much reducing the compliance burden that's on businesses that we are going to be able to see the American people, American businesses, take advantage of that environment. And Jackie, let me add another piece to that, which is the artificial intelligence boom is here.
---
Sun May 25 07:23:46 PDT 2025
 It's that productivity growth that drives economic growth and that means that we need to have enough secure energy and secure technology production here in the United States so that we can indeed win that AI battle. Okay, let me ask you about this when we're talking about growth overall because you've got Goldman Sachs coming out with a report saying the tax cuts are not going to be enough to offset the drag on growth from the tariffs. So then the tariffs come back into the picture, your response. Jackie, if the Secretary of State...
---
Sun May 25 07:24:24 PDT 2025
 and you see this already we are getting our partners and allies as well as some of our adversaries within when we're talking to put things on the table in ways that they haven't been before so as we think about what it is that has stung the ability of American manufacturers to export is that there are these non-tariff restrictions and so if we can use our negotiating leverage the president Trump created on Liberation Day to get countries to put on the table activities that they have previously been unwilling to do

 for people who are legally beneficiaries of those programs. There are a lot of Americans who rely upon those programs and we've got to ensure that they're safe guarded. That's a big priority to the White House and the Republicans in Congress. At the same time, we have to root out fraud waste abuse. We have to eliminate people on, for example, on Medicaid who are not actually eligible to be there. Avalodied workers, for example, young men, who should never be on the program at all. That was the speaker of the House, my friend.

 joining us now is Dr. Memento as administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It's great to have you on the program this morning. So at Speaker Johnson said there, and as the president has said time and time again, we are not doing any cutting of anything meaningful, he said, the president. The only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse. So we're talking about those able-bodied men, for example, receiving benefits. We're talking about illegal immigrants that are on the system because Medicare has been expanded under the Obama administration and a
---
Sun May 25 07:31:14 PDT 2025
 The fraud waste in abuse is in three different categories, the fraud, which by the way we find quite a bit of, there's about 14 billion dollars we've identified with those, folks who are duly enrolled wrongly in multiple states for Medicaid. So you live in New Jersey, but you move to Pennsylvania, which state that your Medicaid turns out, folks, states collect money from the federal government. A lot of times within a state, you'll have someone un-medicate and the exchange. There's again 14 billion dollars just in that regard to law.
---
Sun May 25 07:31:52 PDT 2025
 And you're trying to get a job, which is a good thing because we have twice as many jobs as there are people looking for them right now. But if you don't, or can't, seek a job, you can volunteer somewhere. You can get an education. You can help out with other people inside the household. There's many ways you can shift in and there is a work requirement for SNAP, like the Foustands program. There's a lot we can do to, I think there's a more hazard if we don't, because you've got people who are not working, who could work, who should work and it's better, then they benefit a country if they do. And it's worth about.

Sun May 25 07:32:32 PDT 2025
 be able to clean up Medicaid to it actually serves the people for most rigid design. Those are the dawn of their life, those are the children, those are the twilight of their life, the seniors, and those who are living in the shadows, those who have disabilities, who test with me this program, but aren't getting access to it in a way they should because other folks are clawing at the cloth of the system. Yeah, and you recently wrote about it in an op-ed in the New York Times along with our of K-Junior, Broprawlens, and Scott Turner. I encourage people to read that because it really explains what's happening here that it should not be the way it is.
---
Sun May 25 07:33:12 PDT 2025
 point six million people they say are gonna lose their health insurance at the same time in your post reporting that really what's happening here is just a slow in spend it's not cutting spend um... address to be the democrats make it seem to be from four point six percent per year to three point seven percent so you're taken what their messages and how you need to counter that well the message for me is a very simple one in every scenario i have seen and i think most of them uh... we are

Sun May 25 07:33:49 PDT 2025
 care of people who are vulnerable amongst them that stated we have to make this program sustainable we have to protect it that's what the republicans are trying to do present-run for set over and over again publicly and privately he wants to love and cherish these programs because he wants to love and cherish the people in them but to do that you have to make sure for example they're enough providers if you don't pay providers they do it for free let's say they can do that for you what in seven patients but if you say hey listen half your patients we're not going to pay you for we're gonna make programs that don't reimburse you that doesn't work not provide a

 but the box tops here we've got to clean up the system that we're not paying to a hundred million dollars for housekeeping anymore here uh... we're not going to pay for illegal immigrants in states that are submitting those claims people living in Mississippi or taxis or florida be paying for illegal immigrants getting health care in california as a nation we need to be to be a bit of the online to make this work let me ask you about some of the estimates that are out there with respect to how much this is gonna cost because they're actually hurtles to implementation and there's a little
---
Sun May 25 07:35:07 PDT 2025
 Well, states are incentivized right now not to cooperate with the federal government. Part of what was done with the expansion in Medicaid is a provision that the federal government paid 90% of the tab. As opposed to, for example, 50% of the tab is some other states or 60% of the tab. So the able-bodied individuals actually are getting more money for the state from the federal government. So right now, in many states, if you go to the hospital and you're able-bodied person, the hot list of hot will get paid more than if you're a Medicare-Rip that had a
---
Sun May 25 07:35:47 PDT 2025
 the able-bodied folks are medicaid who haven't been able to get a job so i in the way we sort of value them more and that's what ends up happening that the structure system we need to align the federal government with what the state's desire with the president has to be aligned with the governor that our president is a very feel oriented man as you know he knows uh... with the pressure points are if you don't have parties aligned they're not going to collaborate alright doctor mement on thank you so much for being here this and i really appreciate your time now to the state

 stop and ask ourselves should we be focusing more on school lunch programs not just putting every kid on a exempting. We've got to talk about food as medicine and gut health in the microbiome. We've got to talk about environmental toxins that cause cancer, not just the chemo to treat it. And maybe we need to treat more diabetes with cooking classes, not just throwing insulin at people. And this report is a fresh new approach that really calls for a transformation of our healthcare system.
---
Sun May 25 07:37:41 PDT 2025
 It talks about 70% of the diet being ultra processed. It talks about pesticides, microplastics, natural light exposure in children, sleep quality. I remember Republican Democrat and independent mom showed up in high numbers to vote for President Trump over this very issue. Yeah, and Dr. McAry as you know, I'm a cancer survivor. So after that experience, I dug into the gut and the microbiome and the chemicals and the issues that can impact that potentially for people. So I am with you, but at the same time,

 How do you conduct that? You know, this is a purely independent scientific report on the state of health in America. And let me talk about payment reform. We're really talking about how we fund our broken healthcare system. This report talks about how we fix our broken healthcare system by getting it to root causes and the ultimate issue that we've not been talking about and that is the health of the population. And you have 40% of our nation's children but...

 things that we can do even at the fda addressing food which many people forget is that is the first letter of the fda is food it's not just drugs right let's catch gears for a moment because you just wrote in the new england journal of medicine about an evidence-based approach to coven nineteen vaccination that there should be a new framework for how we look at this especially for young children and this is after that new senate report came out um... alleging that under job i didn't talk officials took steps to actually

Sun May 25 07:39:35 PDT 2025
 vaccine. How are you looking to shake things up at this point in time? Well, Chuck, it was very disappointing when we learned that people at the FDA had hid from the public the myocardia, myocarditis, complication from COVID vaccine in young men and that the incidence is much higher than previously recognized. And so we're making a change to the label but in a much bigger step we're basically saying the day of rubber
---
Sun May 25 07:40:12 PDT 2025
 with no new updated clinical trial data and expect the FDA just to blindly rubber stamp it so in this year in the journal medicine article doctor presod and i basically said we've got a new framework because people don't trust us you know fifteen percent of health care workers got the booster last last uh... season and even fewer parents got the booster for the kids so we we've got to evaluate this and use an evidence based approach and common sense i want to ask you about the pricing on prescription drugs a president

Sun May 25 07:40:50 PDT 2025
 step back and listen to what the president is saying. He's saying that once again Americans are being ripped off and he's going to put a stop to that. Your thoughts. Well, if the president does not like it when Americans are getting massively ripped off and this has been one of the great American ripoffs, we're paying three, five, ten times more for the exact same pill sold in London or Germany or France. And so the president is calling out the companies and I am more so he's calling out the other countries that
---
Sun May 25 07:41:29 PDT 2025
 and it's going to happen. I mean, we're not going to see a one or two percent reduction. I think we're going to see a massive reduction quickly. That's because we're using every care and stick we can to try to move this along and negotiate better prices for Americans. Remember, pharmaceutical companies spend about 15 to 20 percent of their revenue on research and development. And they spend more on these marketing and advertising and commercials where everybody's singing and dancing. And so we can actually work with these companies.
---
Sun May 25 07:42:07 PDT 2025
 the fair share. Right and I'll also make the point that it relevant to the previous conversation we were having those savings on prescription drugs will also benefit Medicare and Medicaid to bring those costs down to which is beneficial.

They're the ones that are going to be able to pass the law to spend the money. And so this has been a very important weekend to meet with them to understand their unique political concerns.

 They are rich as well. That's why drug prices are higher in America. We're paying much more than other countries. Because the middleman makes more money than the drug companies. America is the only country in the world that lets middlemen take up 80% of every dollar spent on medicines. We're going to knock out the middleman, we're going to get drug costs down at levels that nobody has ever seen before. The lower drug prices, we have to cut out the middleman.

 that it's going to end up with a thousand exchange on both sides and that means the sides are talking and it's going to have to be agreement between the Ukrainians and the Russians that are going to have to agree to peace to a lasting peace I think is really important because the killing needs to end but at the same time you know words are one thing but actions speak much louder than words and so both sides are going to have to demonstrate that they're interested in peace and I think that's what President Trump has been trying to determine if both sides especially the Russians are going to have to

 make headway there. Well, again, it's going to be incremental. It's going to be through diplomatic resolution, but President Trump's been clear. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And whether it's through a negotiated solution or some other solution, the United States of America has been very clear about a position that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And at the same time, I think there are other allies, including Israel that feel the same way. And we're going to watch very carefully whether the Iranians

 I think take these steps, you know, obviously trust with verifying at the same time not do anything and not introduce an agreement that can't be verified and it's for going forward. Understood. And in the final minute that we have, obviously we are in a negotiation with China over tariffs in this PODS period as the president and his team tried to make some headway, but I think China coming to the table really showed what the president has been saying over and over again they need us more than we need them, although we both need each other.

 China to the table they do need our market a lot more than we need theirs but you know at the same time the Iowa farmer you know my friends back home that sell their exports to China also would like those markets open i mean it's a competitive world and what President Trump wants is fair trade he doesn't suggest that somehow you know we're specials the United States of America but at the same time he understands there are economy and our innovation is really the envy of the world and so we should receive the benefits from those advantages

 an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has always spread to his bones. Now this is a sad development, I want to wish him and his family the best, and this has been a bipartisan outpouring of sympathy including from President Trump, along with a few heartless critics on the life. The former president released a brief statement with a picture of himself and his life jail, but there are uncomfortable questions that journalists must ask, especially since most of them failed to aggressively pursue

 Let this cancer grow for years and reach the dangerous stage or they just not disclose it to the rest of us. There is, as you might expect, a media divide. Conservative media was right and Conservative media was correct and that there should be a lot of soul-searching not just among men, but among the legacy media to begin with. They're the best doctors in the world.

Sun May 25 08:02:50 PDT 2025
 They have to check the matter, but some of them decided to do this. I think we should pray for the president and pray for his health. And I hope he gets a miracle here. But as a political matter, I think a massive amount of trust has been lost and a massive amount of credibility was spent on covering up for him. And the fact that he wasn't examined for this and tested for this as president is medical negligence. It always seems like the arc of Jill Biden's life is all, is lots of work.

 his focus away from his alien predecessor. Joe Biden was not rough on borders. He never talked about over-mortars. It was the people who knew he was cognitively impaired that took over the auto pen. They stole the presidency of the United States and put us in great danger. This is treason at the highest level. Now, it's hard for me to accept that the revelation of such a serious cancer diagnosis was some kind of PR strategy. The problem is that they have to blame me deceiving the press and-

 and look everyone wants anyone with cancer, my own family, your family, everybody's family, basically watching us right now has had to deal with cancer. It's an awful disease. But this is not an excuse to suddenly stop Joe Biden's mental and physical cognition from being a major topic of discussion. I think personally, the cover up surrounding Joe Biden's health is the biggest lie that any of us천
---
Sun May 25 08:05:59 PDT 2025
 none of us have ever dealt with lies being spread this aggressively. Look, people like me were accused of spreading cheap fakes by Karin Jontier from the White House press briefing room for sharing videos that clearly demonstrated Joe Biden didn't have the ability, the mental or physical cognition, to be president. And so I don't think this story coming out last week changes any of that. I just don't trust them. Lucy, he's back for 150,000 people.

 unlikely and unlike except except that's the command also uh... on msnbc that uh... he don't really had this cancer while he was president and what do you think it plays point uh... about not trusting anything coming from that can i think that those are two separate reds and i think that complaining that is really kind of uh... and unwise and to do i think that yes it is shocking that he has a cancer that is so advanced it is of course also
---
Sun May 25 08:07:51 PDT 2025
 Yeah, so he has this form of cancer and he, it came on, it seems like quite fast. He's fed it younger than you might, and he'd been out in the 60s. People say there's sort of this common wisdom that most men do develop prostate cancer. They die with it, hopefully, and not from it. But I just think the idea that this was part of a concerted effort, there's some optics of this temper of very, very bad for the binding family and for the binding camp. And so I would just say that the idea that this diagnosis and the timing of the ignition of the diagnosis,

 case uh... he used to like talking to report is whether or not uh... so maybe i give them the benefit of the death but by the and his doctors have released almost no details about this answered no questions about the entire matter and when the former president gave a very brief interview with uh... connect with the effort to a local reporter he said i'm feeling great that was a sense of the his commentary on the situation well look i mean it was reckless to run japan

Sun May 25 08:09:43 PDT 2025
 this cancer which is you mentioned Howard MSNBC cancer experts went on and said that they believe he's had it for the entire time that he was in the Oval Office. Look, the fact that Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush all released their PSA test and Biden never did. To me is somewhat skeptical of me I think again because I don't trust them to be honest and I just think we're very lucky as a country.

 and we just saw that the nation, overwhelmingly all 50 states, moved against her, compared to 2020, we did not want her to be president, and if Biden may have managed to drag him across the finish line, we can dead Bernie's two-style. Right now we would have Kamala Harris about to be elevated to President of the United States. Who know one, we just found out in November, wanted to be President of the United States. So I'm thankful for Trump. But really, I feel like we dodged a bullet. Let me jump in.

Sun May 25 08:11:37 PDT 2025
 right now. I also feel great. I also, you know, like you don't know what is going on with your cancer from moment to that. Joe Biden was just out of notes. The fact that his doctors don't have all the information does not get this terribly displeasure that there's a cover-up. Cancer is a treatment to say all different. Right. And it's a moment to moment. No, it was not actually and I will be fine. But it is stage three. But I didn't know I had cancer until six weeks ago, right? And so moment to moment when you have cancer.

 and watching that has deeply wounded all of us. A gunman shouting free Palestine, fairly shooting, and young couple who worked at the Israeli embassy right there on the street. I also spoke to President Trump multiple times, who was just heartbroken and devastated by this. These two young people, they were at a religious event right around the corner from where we're standing, a religious event with friends and with co-workers. They walked outside to go home and...

 It is certainly a surge and it's very concerning. I think it reflects some of the media ecosystems, not traditional media, but the media ecosystems that people are living in online. And the fact that it's a person that we presume is deranged, who's traveled to Washington to commit this act, the way in which the echo chambers that people live in online gives way to just unphoned violence. That is really, really disturbing. So of course it's disturbing. Of course we should be.

 driver dependability comes standard. Like a relentless weed, moderate to severe all-sword of collitis symptoms can keep coming back. Break away to what's possible with trampaya, with rapid relief at four weeks. Many people experienced remission at one and even two years. Some saw 100% physical kneeling of their intestinal lining, serious allergic reactions and increased risk of infection.

 You have an infection flu-like symptoms or you need a vaccine. Human is possible with trampi. Trampi is now approved for Crohn's disease. Has your doctor about trampi? Hey dad, check this out. Baby back ribs. Where does it go? Nobody knows. Oh okay, how did you do that? Honey, he's in the kitchen. It was awesome. Perfectly. Will you just at least not do it to the other rib?

 of Harvard's enrollment. Yeah, the Harvard community is full of international students. That is a thing that is a real point of pride in the Harvard community. You were part of the Harvard community. I was, and I am. And I have a lot to criticize about my alma mater, but I am very, very proud of the position that Harvard has taken in fighting this. But I want this work. This is an authoritarian playbook. This is exactly what this is. This is not about Harvard. This is about showing command and convol of the government, of this administration.

 This work is done for the evening and Gonzalo Rammals has an opportunity to add to his five goals in the cup this season. Only five PS3 players have scored more than Rammals is five in the history of the Coop De Files, since it's been switched to a one-legged format that was in 1990. He's in good company, Guyon Wattle, Tantanipa, Invervitch and Kel Dima Reap.

 Well, it's not a great time to get a real shock to the system like that either, is it? But be through the green, you might get a drop of blafing this down, we're not sure where it's going to be, but if you're on an upslope, so it should be okay, but jail, tell us. Well, he's nearer a drop zone with an uphill line, the one to the right is just a little bit further, had a downhill line. So, where he's going to drop to this?

 place so you would think that better things that have come for John Perry that is for sure in what's already been a wonderful season. Yeah he's left a lot of shots out there the weekend especially on the greens Perry so it'd be pleased with his long game that's for sure. Stage is set. He's hold out well all weekend Ferguson needs one more now.

 and anger that he no doubt feels. That was hard to watch and all honesty because, you know, okay, might've got a bit of a fly with a second shot, but the chip was not great and the putty's very difficult to read. To be fair, you were, you were setting me, I think it could be left to right and you were right. Oh boy, oh boy. He's got to recompose himself and go again.

 to be drastically different than what it was on Friday when they had part of day. So I think they're just going to be thinking about getting through the first turn, getting through these first couple laps and settling into the race. Those drivers have been back in a green room before they got introduced for about a half an hour. And that green room is not luxurious. It's basically a garage that's empty with a chair to sit on. If you're lucky, if not, you find a spot on the ground to sit on to get away from people.

 get to our car and have a gaggle of people around. You have sponsors, you have family, you have all friends, all kinds of people. But look, I never remembered anyone I met on race day because the focus gets so narrow. By the time you get to the car, you honestly just can't wait to put your helmet on and go. All right, well, we know Michael Stray had of course. If you've met him a Super Bowl champion also, he's a car guy, a fanatic. But what if things were a little bit different? Would have been instead of being a pro football hall a favor, let's see what AI would have done to a racing group.

Do you even rub a children's... Alex Polo saying that his kid hated my book. Yeah. And to have Tom Brady be a little annoyed that maybe your jawline is better than his. I mean, not saying something.

Take me through the dark. What do you mean? What do you mean? I don't look at the end. I don't think I'm gonna have to take the lead out of the dark. Oh. You have to get through the stars. Oh.

 your third Indianapolis 500 from the last row? Well, I think for us we have to focus on doing our job today, right? This is, we've showed up for race day. It takes a long time to get here. 365 days to build these cars, get them prepped, and then you go through the three weeks this whole process of practice qualifying. It all comes down to this one moment, and I think for us we got to focus on execution. That's what this race rewards. Our team can do that better than anybody. I love the men and women around me. They are my team, and we're going to go fight.
---
Sun May 25 09:11:44 PDT 2025
 It's my favorite place in the world. Love this race. And I think with the shell car and our partner team Chevy, we can definitely get to the front. He's going for the three pete. That is Joseph Newgarden. All right, so there's a round of controversy. Fair or not. Can it affect him at all? He has speed, aggression, pit stops, strategy. Nobody's better than Penske at that stuff. If anybody's going to come and win from the back room from the very first time in history, I think it's going to be Joseph. Watching him on carb day. I mean, top of the board.

And you can play along also with James and his thick award. Hello, his top three and the clock. Well, by the way, nearly 45% of the winners of the Indy 500 have come from the front row this week on the ranking sportsman, new customers. Can bet $5.

 So you think he'll fit in this race car? Oh man, I don't know. Rob, you're a pretty big guy. We might have to cut a few extra holes to get your feet out at the top of the tub or something, but I'm sure we can figure it out. I could be like a Flintstone. Robbie Flintstone out there just propelling with my feet. Well you have a beautiful car here in my man one day I'll get in there. All right, have fun. Good luck to you today, Steve Raybott. Let's move up the grid here, Gronk. There's a lot of people out here. We got to kind of push and shove our way. See drivers, friends. Yeah, but this is easy compared to the snake pit. I mean those were main areas.

 do the double today. I don't, Larsen. This is kind of like the football, but I think of you doing a NFL game, Brock, and then doing a basketball game right out there. I agree, but I kind of compare this to Deon Sanders. Deon Sanders, playing the football game, then playing the baseball game that night, and Kyle Larsen is going to be kind of doing the same thing. Racing here today in the, in the, in theapolis, and then going over to the Caroline, so race again. Mind blowing. Well, this is perfect because Larsen had to go to the bathroom. That's what the driver's student, before they're racing for four hours.

It's been wonderful. All right. Good luck to you. Thank you so much this weekend celebrating Memorial Day weekend Fox Sports. It's proud to be here and we thank you for watching.
